## Project Details

Bored.io helps you find things to do when you're bored, and keeps track of what you've completed or might want to do in the future.

I made this little project to primarily get some practice with **VueJS** and **Vuetify**, pulling data from an external api (Bored API), and storing/loading user data.

### Development

I used **Firebase's** Realtime Database to store and load data, which is incredibly useful for small things like this.

On the front-end I used **VueJS** to build out the UI/functionality, *specifically*:

- **Vuex** for state management
- **Vue Router** for navigation/routing
- **Vuetify** for UI

Finally, I deployed the app directly from Github with **Netlify**.

I can't lie to myself and say that I regularly use it to find things to do because I have *plenty* of things to keep me busy, but hopefully it can give you some new ideas!
