## Project Details

Bored.io helps you find things to do when you're bored and keeps track of what you've completed or the tasks you might want to do in the future.

I made this little project to primarily get some practice with using **VueJS** and **Vuetify** to build out a UI, pulling data from an api, storing/loading data in **Firebase**, and deploying the app to **Netlify**.
