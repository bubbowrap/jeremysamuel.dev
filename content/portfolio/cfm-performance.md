## Project Details

CFM Performance specializes in automotive performance parts and accessories for Ford Focus, Mustang and Fiesta. They needed a new site that was mobile responsive, was able to compete visually with similar sites, and used the latest version of ProductCart.

I performed most tasks from design to front end development using **HTML5**, **CSS3**, **Twitter Bootstrap**, and **jQuery/javascript** on top of the ProductCart E-commerce system.
