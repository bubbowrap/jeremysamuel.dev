## Project Details

Elan Polo wanted to update and upgrade their Crevo Footwear store to be mobile responsive,so they contacted NetSource Technologies. Their internal team provided the desktop design mockups, and I turned their designs into working code. I mirrored it as closely as I could while also deciding on how the design would look and function on mobile devices.

I performed most front end development tasks using **HTML5**, **CSS3**, **Twitter Bootstrap**, and **jQuery/javascript** on top of the ProductCart E-commerce system.
