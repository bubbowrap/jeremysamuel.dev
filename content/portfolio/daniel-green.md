## Project Details

Elan Polo wanted to update and upgrade their online stores to be mobile responsive, so they contacted NetSource Technologies. Their internal team provided the desktop design mockups, and I turned their designs into working code. I mirrored it as closely as I could while also figuring out how the design would look and function on mobile devices. This project was slightly more complicated because itâ€™s actually three different (but similar) sites using the same ProductCart database; we managed this by having a theme switcher that changed the CSS/homepage design depending on which domain the user was visiting from.

This site was built using **HTML5**, **CSS3**, **Twitter Bootstrap**, and **jQuery/javascript** on top of the ProductCart E-commerce system.
