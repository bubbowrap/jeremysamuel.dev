## Project Details

The leaders of Marion County are determined to help residents take control of their health, and one of the ways theyâ€™re doing that is building a site where users can find information on how to do so. The goal was to make it fast, easily accessible, appeal to a wide range of people, and easy to manage (using the WordPress CMS).

I performed most tasks from design to front end development using **HTML5**, **CSS3**, **Bootstrap**, and **jQuery/javascript** on top of the **Wordpress CMS**.
