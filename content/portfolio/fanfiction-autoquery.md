## Project Details

If you've spent way too much time on the fanfiction site Archive Of Our Own (AO3) like I have, you've probably run up against the issue of not being able to save your most used tags and filters. Having to go through the painstaking process of including the things you want and excluding the things you don't want gets old fast, and if you have very specific tastes setting up each search can easily take 1-2 minutes which you need to do *each time you want to read something*.

This app fixes that. Save and view all of your top visited queries in one central location and get some of your precious time back. It was built using **VueJS** and **Vuetify** for the front-end development, and **Firebase** for the back-end. 

### Development

I used **Firebase** to handle most of the back-end development. What's great is that without very much code at all you can do a whole lot, and I used it mainly for its:

- Realtime Database
- Authentication (Google)
- Image Storage

On the front-end I used **VueJS** to build out the UI/functionality, and more *specifically*:

- **Vuex** for state management
- **Vue Router** for navigation/routing
- **Vuetify** for UI

Finally, I deployed the app directly from Github with **Netlify**.

Overall, this was definitely my most ambitious project. There were a lot of new concepts to wrangle with and many moving parts besides, but it's all stuff I've already found incredibly useful in my day to day work and will carry with me onto future projects.

All that to say: Yes, I really did build a whole app just to feed my fanfiction addiction.
